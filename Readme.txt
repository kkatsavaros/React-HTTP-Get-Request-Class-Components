React-HTTP-Get-Request-Class-Components

http://localhost:3000/




In that project i make a Get Request and i retrieve data from an API End Point, using AXIOS library.

The API end point is: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts.

Also in that project i use Class Components.

If something is going wrong with getting data, the project shows a message.
